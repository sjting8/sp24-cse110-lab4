1. Line 12 will print 3 because i is the iteration variable of the for loop and line 12 prints what i equals after the loop ends. The loop ends when i is no longer less than the length of the prices array, and since i starts at 0 and increments by 1, i will equal the length of the prices array when it ends. The array prices, in this scenario, has the length of 3 so 3 is printed.
2. Line 13 will print 150 because since this line is after the for loop, discountedPrice will be set to prices[i] * (1 - discount), where i is the last iteration that occurs in the for loop. That means, in this scenario, i = 2, and prices[i] = 300. Since discount is 0.5, discountedPrice is set to 150 before exiting the for loop and then it is printed.
3. Similarly to number 2, line 14 will print 150 because since this line is after the for loop, finalPrice will be the rounded version of discountedPrice, which we showed is equal to 150, therefore, finalPrice will be equal to 150 at the end of the for loop and this will be what is printed.
